# Weapon Ballistic System
Weapon Ballistic System - a legacy Unity3D study project, which implements realistic bullet ballistics and penetration.

---

# Features
  - ##### Optimization
    This system is based only on raycasts and works with projectile pool and don't use additional memory once scene is started. Optimized draw calls count.
  - ##### Realistic behaviour
     Projectiles ricochets and penetrates world obstacles, based on obstacle's and projectile's properties. WBS supports derrivation and gun temperature.
  - ##### Universality
     System uses **Physics.gravity** and **Time.timeScale** to simulate projectiles. Perfectly works with slow-mo.


---
# Improvements
  - ##### Wind zones or global wind direction can be implemented.
  - ##### Dynamic world material determination
  ---
# Support
 -  ##### This project will not be supported due its development direction. It's not possible to implement some features with this kind of project direction
